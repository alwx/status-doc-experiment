The name of your command. Should consist of letters and digits. Special symbols are allowed (except `/` and `@`), 
but it's not recommended to use them â€” users can execute commands by typing their names manually, thus it makes sense
to make names as simple as possible.

## Good names

* `my-command`
* `location`
* `debug`
* `step1`

## Bad names

* `my_command` (because typing `_` requires to switch a keyboard)
* `pay&send`
* `send@`
